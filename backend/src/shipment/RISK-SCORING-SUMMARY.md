# Risk Scoring System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the risk scoring system for shipments in the FreightFlow application.

## Files Created

### 1. Core Implementation
- **[risk-scoring.service.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/risk-scoring.service.ts)**: Main service for calculating risk scores based on cargo type, carrier reliability, route risk, and geopolitical factors.

### 2. Data Models
- **[shipment.entity.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/shipment.entity.ts)**: Extended with risk scoring fields:
  - `cargoType`: Enum for different cargo types
  - `riskScore`: Decimal for total risk score (0-100)
  - `riskLevel`: Enum for risk categories (low, medium, high, critical)
  - `riskFactors`: JSON for detailed factor breakdown

### 3. Data Transfer Objects
- **[dto/calculate-risk.dto.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/dto/calculate-risk.dto.ts)**: DTO for risk calculation requests

### 4. Interfaces
- **[interfaces/risk-scoring.interface.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/interfaces/risk-scoring.interface.ts)**: TypeScript interfaces for risk scoring functionality

### 5. Module Configuration
- **[shipment.module.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/shipment.module.ts)**: Updated to include RiskScoringService

### 6. Service Extensions
- **[shipment.service.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/shipment.service.ts)**: Extended with risk scoring methods:
  - `calculateRiskScore()`: Calculate and update risk score for a shipment
  - `getShipmentsByRiskLevel()`: Filter shipments by risk level
  - `getRiskStatistics()`: Get overall risk statistics

### 7. API Endpoints
- **[shipment.controller.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/k-aliyu/Documents/GitHub/FrieghtFlow/backend/src/shipment/shipment.controller.ts)**: Extended with risk scoring endpoints:
  - `POST /shipments/:id/calculate-risk`: Calculate risk score
  - `GET /shipments/risk-level/:riskLevel`: Filter by risk level
  - `GET /shipments/risk-statistics`: Get risk statistics

## Risk Factors and Scoring

### 1. Cargo Type (0-30 points)
- General: 5 points
- Fragile: 15 points
- Perishable: 20 points
- High-Value: 25 points
- Live Animals: 25 points
- Hazardous: 30 points

### 2. Carrier Reliability (0-25 points)
Based on carrier performance metrics:
- Excellent (90-100%): 5 points
- Good (80-89%): 10 points
- Average (70-79%): 15 points
- Below Average (60-69%): 20 points
- Poor (<60%): 25 points

### 3. Route Risk (0-25 points)
- Distance factor (3-10 points)
- Route type (0-8 points)
- Route reliability (0-10 points)

### 4. Geopolitical Risk (0-20 points)
- Low risk countries: 2 points
- Medium risk countries: 10 points
- High risk countries: 20 points

## Risk Levels
- **Low Risk**: 0-29 points
- **Medium Risk**: 30-59 points
- **High Risk**: 60-79 points
- **Critical Risk**: 80-100 points

## API Endpoints

### Calculate Risk Score
```
POST /shipments/{id}/calculate-risk
```
Calculates and updates the risk score for a specific shipment.

### Get Shipments by Risk Level
```
GET /shipments/risk-level/{riskLevel}
```
Returns shipments filtered by risk level (low, medium, high, critical).

### Get Risk Statistics
```
GET /shipments/risk-statistics
```
Returns overall risk statistics including distribution and averages.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. External Data Integration
- Real-time geopolitical risk APIs
- Weather and seasonal data for route risk
- Carrier performance tracking systems

### 2. Machine Learning
- Predictive risk modeling
- Anomaly detection for unusual risk patterns
- Continuous model improvement based on outcomes

### 3. Advanced Features
- Real-time risk monitoring
- Automated risk alerts
- Dynamic risk recalculation based on events
- Historical risk trend analysis
